This article will first examine what AI is, discuss its impact on industrial, social, and economic changes on humankind in the 21st century, and then propose a set of principles for AI bioethics. The IR1.0, the IR of the 18th century, impelled a huge social change without directly complicating human relationships. Modern AI, however, has a tremendous impact on how we do things and also the ways we relate to one another. Facing this challenge, new principles of AI bioethics must be considered and developed to provide guidelines for the AI technology to observe so that the world will be benefited by the progress of this new intelligence.KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence, Bioethics, Principles of artificial intelligence bioethicsWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?Artificial intelligence (AI) has many different definitions; some see it as the created technology that allows computers and machines to function intelligently. Some see it as the machine that replaces human labor to work for men a more effective and speedier result. Others see it as “a system” with the ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation [1].Despite the different definitions, the common understanding of AI is that it is associated with machines and computers to help humankind solve problems and facilitate working processes. In short, it is an intelligence designed by humans and demonstrated by machines. The term AI is used to describe these functions of human-made tool that emulates the “cognitive” abilities of the natural intelligence of human minds [2].Along with the rapid development of cybernetic technology in recent years, AI has been seen almost in all our life circles, and some of that may no longer be regarded as AI because it is so common in daily life that we are much used to it such as optical character recognition or the Siri (speech interpretation and recognition interface) of information searching equipment on computer [3].DIFFERENT TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEFrom the functions and abilities provided by AI, we can distinguish two different types. The first is weak AI, also known as narrow AI that is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or Internet Siri search or self-driving car. Many currently existing systems that claim to use “AI” are likely operating as a weak AI focusing on a narrowly defined specific function. Although this weak AI seems to be helpful to human living, there are still some think weak AI could be dangerous because weak AI could cause disruptions in the electric grid or may damage nuclear power plants when malfunctioned.The new development of the long-term goal of many researchers is to create strong AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI) which is the speculative intelligence of a machine that has the capacity to understand or learn any intelligent task human being can, thus assisting human to unravel the confronted problem. While narrow AI may outperform humans such as playing chess or solving equations, but its effect is still weak. AGI, however, could outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.Strong AI is a different perception of AI that it can be programmed to actually be a human mind, to be intelligent in whatever it is commanded to attempt, even to have perception, beliefs and other cognitive capacities that are normally only ascribed to humans [4].In summary, we can see these different functions of AI [5,6]:\n",
            "Automation: What makes a system or process to function automaticallyMachine learning and vision: The science of getting a computer to act through deep learning to predict and analyze, and to see through a camera, analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal processingNatural language processing: The processing of human language by a computer program, such as spam detection and converting instantly a language to another to help humans communicateRobotics: A field of engineering focusing on the design and manufacturing of cyborgs, the so-called machine man. They are used to perform tasks for human's convenience or something too difficult or dangerous for human to perform and can operate without stopping such as in assembly linesSelf-driving car: Use a combination of computer vision, image recognition amid deep learning to build automated control in a vehicle.\n",
            "DO HUMAN-BEINGS REALLY NEED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?Is AI really needed in human society? It depends. If human opts for a faster and effective way to complete their work and to work constantly without taking a break, yes, it is. However if humankind is satisfied with a natural way of living without excessive desires to conquer the order of nature, it is not. History tells us that human is always looking for something faster, easier, more effective, and convenient to finish the task they work on; therefore, the pressure for further development motivates humankind to look for a new and better way of doing things. Humankind as the homo-sapiens discovered that tools could facilitate many hardships for daily livings and through tools they invented, human could complete the work better, faster, smarter and more effectively. The invention to create new things becomes the incentive of human progress. We enjoy a much easier and more leisurely life today all because of the contribution of technology. The human society has been using the tools since the beginning of civilization, and human progress depends on it. The human kind living in the 21st century did not have to work as hard as their forefathers in previous times because they have new machines to work for them. It is all good and should be all right for these AI but a warning came in early 20th century as the human-technology kept developing that Aldous Huxley warned in his book Brave New World that human might step into a world in which we are creating a monster or a super human with the development of genetic technology.Besides, up-to-dated AI is breaking into healthcare industry too by assisting doctors to diagnose, finding the sources of diseases, suggesting various ways of treatment performing surgery and also predicting if the illness is life-threatening [7]. A recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot to perform soft-tissue surgery, stitch together a pig's bowel, and the robot finished the job better than a human surgeon, the team claimed [8,9]. It demonstrates robotically-assisted surgery can overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally-invasive surgical procedures and to enhance the capacities of surgeons performing open surgery.Above all, we see the high-profile examples of AI including autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays…etc. All these have made human life much easier and convenient that we are so used to them and take them for granted. AI has become indispensable, although it is not absolutely needed without it our world will be in chaos in many ways today.THE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON HUMAN SOCIETYNegative impactQuestions have been asked: With the progressive development of AI, human labor will no longer be needed as everything can be done mechanically. Will humans become lazier and eventually degrade to the stage that we return to our primitive form of being? The process of evolution takes eons to develop, so we will not notice the backsliding of humankind. However how about if the AI becomes so powerful that it can program itself to be in charge and disobey the order given by its master, the humankind?Let us see the negative impact the AI will have on human society [10,11]:\n",
            "A huge social change that disrupts the way we live in the human community will occur. Humankind has to be industrious to make their living, but with the service of AI, we can just program the machine to do a thing for us without even lifting a tool. Human closeness will be gradually diminishing as AI will replace the need for people to meet face to face for idea exchange. AI will stand in between people as the personal gathering will no longer be needed for communicationUnemployment is the next because many works will be replaced by machinery. Today, many automobile assembly lines have been filled with machineries and robots, forcing traditional workers to lose their jobs. Even in supermarket, the store clerks will not be needed anymore as the digital device can take over human laborWealth inequality will be created as the investors of AI will take up the major share of the earnings. The gap between the rich and the poor will be widened. The so-called “M” shape wealth distribution will be more obviousNew issues surface not only in a social sense but also in AI itself as the AI being trained and learned how to operate the given task can eventually take off to the stage that human has no control, thus creating un-anticipated problems and consequences. It refers to AI's capacity after being loaded with all needed algorithm may automatically function on its own course ignoring the command given by the human controllerThe human masters who create AI may invent something that is racial bias or egocentrically oriented to harm certain people or things. For instance, the United Nations has voted to limit the spread of nucleus power in fear of its indiscriminative use to destroying humankind or targeting on certain races or region to achieve the goal of domination. AI is possible to target certain race or some programmed objects to accomplish the command of destruction by the programmers, thus creating world disaster.\n",
            "POSITIVE IMPACTThere are, however, many positive impacts on humans as well, especially in the field of healthcare. AI gives computers the capacity to learn, reason, and apply logic. Scientists, medical researchers, clinicians, mathematicians, and engineers, when working together, can design an AI that is aimed at medical diagnosis and treatments, thus offering reliable and safe systems of health-care delivery. As health professors and medical researchers endeavor to find new and efficient ways of treating diseases, not only the digital computer can assist in analyzing, robotic systems can also be created to do some delicate medical procedures with precision. Here, we see the contribution of AI to health care [7,11]:Fast and accurate diagnosticsIBM's Watson computer has been used to diagnose with the fascinating result. Loading the data to the computer will instantly get AI's diagnosis. AI can also provide various ways of treatment for physicians to consider. The procedure is something like this: To load the digital results of physical examination to the computer that will consider all possibilities and automatically diagnose whether or not the patient suffers from some deficiencies and illness and even suggest various kinds of available treatment.Socially therapeutic robotsPets are recommended to senior citizens to ease their tension and reduce blood pressure, anxiety, loneliness, and increase social interaction. Now cyborgs have been suggested to accompany those lonely old folks, even to help do some house chores. Therapeutic robots and the socially assistive robot technology help improve the quality of life for seniors and physically challenged [12].Reduce errors related to human fatigueHuman error at workforce is inevitable and often costly, the greater the level of fatigue, the higher the risk of errors occurring. Al technology, however, does not suffer from fatigue or emotional distraction. It saves errors and can accomplish the duty faster and more accurately.Artificial intelligence-based surgical contributionAI-based surgical procedures have been available for people to choose. Although this AI still needs to be operated by the health professionals, it can complete the work with less damage to the body. The da Vinci surgical system, a robotic technology allowing surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures, is available in most of the hospitals now. These systems enable a degree of precision and accuracy far greater than the procedures done manually. The less invasive the surgery, the less trauma it will occur and less blood loss, less anxiety of the patients.Improved radiologyThe first computed tomography scanners were introduced in 1971. The first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the human body took place in 1977. By the early 2000s, cardiac MRI, body MRI, and fetal imaging, became routine. The search continues for new algorithms to detect specific diseases as well as to analyze the results of scans [9]. All those are the contribution of the technology of AI.Virtual presenceThe virtual presence technology can enable a distant diagnosis of the diseases. The patient does not have to leave his/her bed but using a remote presence robot, doctors can check the patients without actually being there. Health professionals can move around and interact almost as effectively as if they were present. This allows specialists to assist patients who are unable to travel.SOME CAUTIONS TO BE REMINDEDDespite all the positive promises that AI provides, human experts, however, are still essential and necessary to design, program, and operate the AI from any unpredictable error from occurring. Beth Kindig, a San Francisco-based technology analyst with more than a decade of experience in analyzing private and public technology companies, published a free newsletter indicating that although AI has a potential promise for better medical diagnosis, human experts are still needed to avoid the misclassification of unknown diseases because AI is not omnipotent to solve all problems for human kinds. There are times when AI meets an impasse, and to carry on its mission, it may just proceed indiscriminately, ending in creating more problems. Thus vigilant watch of AI's function cannot be neglected. This reminder is known as physician-in-the-loop [13].The question of an ethical AI consequently was brought up by Elizabeth Gibney in her article published in Nature to caution any bias and possible societal harm [14]. The Neural Information processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference in Vancouver Canada in 2020 brought up the ethical controversies of the application of AI technology, such as in predictive policing or facial recognition, that due to bias algorithms can result in hurting the vulnerable population [14]. For instance, the NeurIPS can be programmed to target certain race or decree as the probable suspect of crime or trouble makers.THE CHALLENGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BIOETHICSArtificial intelligence ethics must be developedBioethics is a discipline that focuses on the relationship among living beings. Bioethics accentuates the good and the right in biospheres and can be categorized into at least three areas, the bioethics in health settings that is the relationship between physicians and patients, the bioethics in social settings that is the relationship among humankind and the bioethics in environmental settings that is the relationship between man and nature including animal ethics, land ethics, ecological ethics…etc. All these are concerned about relationships within and among natural existences.As AI arises, human has a new challenge in terms of establishing a relationship toward something that is not natural in its own right. Bioethics normally discusses the relationship within natural existences, either humankind or his environment, that are parts of natural phenomena. But now men have to deal with something that is human-made, artificial and unnatural, namely AI. Human has created many things yet never has human had to think of how to ethically relate to his own creation. AI by itself is without feeling or personality. AI engineers have realized the importance of giving the AI ability to discern so that it will avoid any deviated activities causing unintended harm. From this perspective, we understand that AI can have a negative impact on humans and society; thus, a bioethics of AI becomes important to make sure that AI will not take off on its own by deviating from its originally designated purpose.Stephen Hawking warned early in 2014 that the development of full AI could spell the end of the human race. He said that once humans develop AI, it may take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate [15]. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, could not compete and would be superseded. In his book Superintelligence, Nick Bostrom gives an argument that AI will pose a threat to humankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI can exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down, and it might harm humanity [16].The question is–do we have to think of bioethics for the human's own created product that bears no bio-vitality? Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental state in exactly the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be sentient and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine intentionally cause harm? Regulations must be contemplated as a bioethical mandate for AI production.Studies have shown that AI can reflect the very prejudices humans have tried to overcome. As AI becomes “truly ubiquitous,” it has a tremendous potential to positively impact all manner of life, from industry to employment to health care and even security. Addressing the risks associated with the technology, Janosch Delcker, Politico Europe's AI correspondent, said: “I don't think AI will ever be free of bias, at least not as long as we stick to machine learning as we know it today,”…. “What's crucially important, I believe, is to recognize that those biases exist and that policymakers try to mitigate them” [17]. The High-Level Expert Group on AI of the European Union presented Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI in 2019 that suggested AI systems must be accountable, explainable, and unbiased. Three emphases are given:\n",
            "Lawful-respecting all applicable laws and regulationsEthical-respecting ethical principles and valuesRobust-being adaptive, reliable, fair, and trustworthy from a technical perspective while taking into account its social environment [18].\n",
            "Seven requirements are recommended [18]:\n",
            "AI should not trample on human autonomy. People should not be manipulated or coerced by AI systems, and humans should be able to intervene or oversee every decision that the software makesAI should be secure and accurate. It should not be easily compromised by external attacks, and it should be reasonably reliablePersonal data collected by AI systems should be secure and private. It should not be accessible to just anyone, and it should not be easily stolenData and algorithms used to create an AI system should be accessible, and the decisions made by the software should be “understood and traced by human beings.” In other words, operators should be able to explain the decisions their AI systems makeServices provided by AI should be available to all, regardless of age, gender, race, or other characteristics. Similarly, systems should not be biased along these linesAI systems should be sustainable (i.e., they should be ecologically responsible) and “enhance positive social change”AI systems should be auditable and covered by existing protections for corporate whistleblowers. The negative impacts of systems should be acknowledged and reported in advance.\n",
            "From these guidelines, we can suggest that future AI must be equipped with human sensibility or “AI humanities.” To accomplish this, AI researchers, manufacturers, and all industries must bear in mind that technology is to serve not to manipulate humans and his society. Bostrom and Judkowsky listed responsibility, transparency, auditability, incorruptibility, and predictability [19] as criteria for the computerized society to think about.SUGGESTED PRINCIPLES FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BIOETHICSNathan Strout, a reporter at Space and Intelligence System at Easter University, USA, reported just recently that the intelligence community is developing its own AI ethics. The Pentagon made announced in February 2020 that it is in the process of adopting principles for using AI as the guidelines for the department to follow while developing new AI tools and AI-enabled technologies. Ben Huebner, chief of the Office of Director of National Intelligence's Civil Liberties, Privacy, and Transparency Office, said that “We're going to need to ensure that we have transparency and accountability in these structures as we use them. They have to be secure and resilient” [20]. Two themes have been suggested for the AI community to think more about: Explainability and interpretability. Explainability is the concept of understanding how the analytic works, while interpretability is being able to understand a particular result produced by an analytic [20].All the principles suggested by scholars for AI bioethics are well-brought-up. I gather from different bioethical principles in all the related fields of bioethics to suggest four principles here for consideration to guide the future development of the AI technology. We however must bear in mind that the main attention should still be placed on human because AI after all has been designed and manufactured by human. AI proceeds to its work according to its algorithm. AI itself cannot empathize nor have the ability to discern good from evil and may commit mistakes in processes. All the ethical quality of AI depends on the human designers; therefore, it is an AI bioethics and at the same time, a trans-bioethics that abridge human and material worlds. Here are the principles:\n",
            "Beneficence: Beneficence means doing good, and here it refers to the purpose and functions of AI should benefit the whole human life, society and universe. Any AI that will perform any destructive work on bio-universe, including all life forms, must be avoided and forbidden. The AI scientists must understand that reason of developing this technology has no other purpose but to benefit human society as a whole not for any individual personal gain. It should be altruistic, not egocentric in natureValue-upholding: This refers to AI's congruence to social values, in other words, universal values that govern the order of the natural world must be observed. AI cannot elevate to the height above social and moral norms and must be bias-free. The scientific and technological developments must be for the enhancement of human well-being that is the chief value AI must hold dearly as it progresses furtherLucidity: AI must be transparent without hiding any secret agenda. It has to be easily comprehensible, detectable, incorruptible, and perceivable. AI technology should be made available for public auditing, testing and review, and subject to accountability standards … In high-stakes settings like diagnosing cancer from radiologic images, an algorithm that can't “explain its work” may pose an unacceptable risk. Thus, explainability and interpretability are absolutely requiredAccountability: AI designers and developers must bear in mind they carry a heavy responsibility on their shoulders of the outcome and impact of AI on whole human society and the universe. They must be accountable for whatever they manufacture and create.\n",
            "CONCLUSIONAI is here to stay in our world and we must try to enforce the AI bioethics of beneficence, value upholding, lucidity and accountability. Since AI is without a soul as it is, its bioethics must be transcendental to bridge the shortcoming of AI's inability to empathize. AI is a reality of the world. We must take note of what Joseph Weizenbaum, a pioneer of AI, said that we must not let computers make important decisions for us because AI as a machine will never possess human qualities such as compassion and wisdom to morally discern and judge [10]. Bioethics is not a matter of calculation but a process of conscientization. Although AI designers can up-load all information, data, and programmed to AI to function as a human being, it is still a machine and a tool. AI will always remain as AI without having authentic human feelings and the capacity to commiserate. Therefore, AI technology must be progressed with extreme caution. As Von der Leyen said in White Paper on AI – A European approach to excellence and trust: “AI must serve people, and therefore, AI must always comply with people's rights…. High-risk AI. That potentially interferes with people's rights has to be tested and certified before it reaches our single market” [21].Financial support and sponsorshipNil.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.REFERENCES1.

            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the use of “computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind,” according to IBM. [1] \n",
            "The idea of AI dates back at least 2,700 years. As Adrienne Mayor, research scholar, folklorist, and science historian at Stanford University, explains: “Our ability to imagine artificial intelligence goes back to ancient times. Long before technological advances made self-moving devices possible, ideas about creating artificial life and robots were explored in ancient myths.” [2] \n",
            "Mayor notes that the myths about Hephaestus, the Greek god of invention and blacksmithing, included precursors to AI. For example, Hephaestus created the giant bronze man, Talos, which had a mysterious life force from the gods called ichor. Hephaestus also created Pandora and her infamous box, as well as a set of automated servants made of gold that were given the knowledge of the gods. Mayor concludes, “Not one of those myths has a good ending once the artificial beings are sent to Earth. It’s almost as if the myths say that it’s great to have these artificial things up in heaven used by the gods. But once they interact with humans, we get chaos and destruction.” [2] \n",
            "The modern notion of AI largely began when Alan Turing, who contributed to breaking the Nazi’s Enigma code during World War II, created the Turing test to determine if a computer is capable of “thinking.” The value and legitimacy of the test have long been debated. [1] [3] [4]\n",
            "The “Father of Artificial Intelligence,” John McCarthy, coined the term “artificial intelligence” when he, with Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon, proposed a 1956 summer workshop on the topic at Dartmouth College. McCarthy defined artificial intelligence as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” He later created the computer programming language LISP (which is still used in AI), hosted computer chess games against human Russian opponents, and developed the first computer with ”hand-eye” capability, all important building blocks for AI. [1] [5] [6] [7]\n",
            "The first AI program designed to mimic how humans solve problems, Logic Theorist, was created by Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon in 1955-1956. The program was designed to solve problems from Principia Mathematica (1910-13) written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. [1] [8] \n",
            "In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt invented the Perceptron, which he claimed was “the first machine which is capable of having an original idea.” Though the machine was hounded by skeptics, it was later praised as the “foundations for all of this artificial intelligence.” [1] [9] \n",
            "As computers became cheaper in the 1960s and 70s, AI programs such as Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA flourished, and U.S. government agencies including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began to fund AI-related research. But computers were still too weak to manage the language tasks researchers asked of them. Another influx of funding in the 1980s and early 90s furthered the research, including the invention of expert systems by Edward Feigenbaum and Joshua Lederberg. But progress again waned with another drop in government funding. [10] \n",
            "In 1997, Gary Kasparov, reigning world chess champion and grand master, was defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue AI computer program, a major event in AI history. More recently, advances in computer storage limits and speeds have opened new avenues for AI research and implementation, aiding scientific research and forging new paths in medicine for patient diagnosis, robotic surgery, and drug development. [1] [10] [11] [12] \n",
            "Now, artificial intelligence is used for a variety of everyday implementations including facial recognition software, online shopping algorithms, search engines, digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, translation services, automated safety functions on cars, cybersecurity, airport body scanning security, poker playing strategy, and fighting disinformation on social media. [13] [58] \n",
            "With the field growing by leaps and bounds, on Mar. 29, 2023, tech giants including Elon Musk,  Steve Wozniak, Craig Peters (CEO of Getty Images), author Yuval Noah Harari, and politician Andrew Yang published an open letter calling for a six-month pause on AI “systems more powerful than GPT-4.” (The latter, “Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4,” is an AI model that can generate human-like text and images.) The letter states, “Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable…. AI research and development should be refocused on making today’s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.” Within a day of its release, the letter had garnered 1380 signatures—from engineers, professors, artists, and grandmothers alike. [59] [62]\n",
            "On Oct. 30, 2023, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that “establishes new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around the world, and more.” Vice President Kamala Harris stated, “We have a moral, ethical and societal duty to make sure that A.I. is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm. We intend that the actions we are taking domestically will serve as a model for international action.” [60] [61] \n",
            "Despite such precautions, experts noted that many of the new standards would be difficult to enforce, especially as new concerns and controversies over AI evolve almost daily. AI developers, for example, have faced criticism for using copyrighted work to train AI models and for politically skewing AI-produced information. Generative programs such as ChatGPT and DALL-E3 claim to produce “original” output because developers have exposed the programs to huge databases of existing texts and images,material that consists of copyrighted works. OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as other AI companies, have been sued by The New York Times, Microsoft, countless authors including Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, Sarah Silverman, and John Grisham, music publishers including Universal Music Publishing Group, and numerous visual artists as well as Getty Images, among others. Many companies’ terms of service, including Encyclopaedia Britannica, now require that AI companies obtain written permission to data mine for AI bot training.  [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70]\n",
            "Controversy arose yet again in early 2024, when Google’s AI chatbot Gemini began skewing historical events by generating images of racially diverse 1940s German Nazi soldiers and Catholic popes (including a Black female pope). Republican lawmakers accused Google of promoting leftist ideology and spreading disinformation through its AI tool. Globally, fears have been expressed that such technology could undermine the democratic process in upcoming elections. As a result, Google agreed to correct its faulty historical imaging and to limit election-related queries in countries with forthcoming elections. Similarly, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) outlawed the use of AI-generated voices in robocalls after a New Hampshire political group was found to be placing robocalls featuring an AI-generated voice that mimicked President Joe Biden in an effort to suppress Democratic party primary voting.

            "Why sit in a traffic jam when a map app can navigate you around the car accident? Why fumble with shopping bags searching for your keys in the dark when a preset location-based command can have your doorway illuminated as you approach your now unlocked door? [23] \n",
            "Why scroll through hundreds of possible TV shows when the streaming app already knows what genres you like? Why forget eggs at the grocery store when a digital assistant can take an inventory of your refrigerator and add them to your grocery list and have them delivered to your home? All of these marvels are assisted by AI technology. [23] \n",
            "AI-enabled fitness apps boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic when gyms were closed, increasing the number of AI options for at-home workouts. Now, you can not only set a daily steps goal with encouragement reminders on your smart watch, but you can ride virtually through the countryside on a Peloton bike from your garage or have a personal trainer on your living room TV. For more specialized fitness, AI wearables can monitor yoga poses or golf and baseball swings. [24] [25] \n",
            "AI can even enhance your doctor’s appointments and medical procedures. It can alert medical caregivers to patterns in your health data as compared to the vast library of medical data, while also doing the paperwork tied to medical appointments so doctors have more time to focus on their patients, resulting in more personalized care. AI can even help surgeons be quicker, more accurate, and more minimally invasive in their operations. [26] \n",
            "Smart speakers including Amazon’s Echo can use AI to soothe babies to sleep and monitor their breathing. Using AI, speakers can also detect regular and irregular heartbeats, as well as heart attacks and congestive heart failure. [27] [28] [29] \n",

            "Much like a calculator did not signal the end of students’ grasp of mathematics knowledge, typing did not eliminate handwriting, and Google did not herald the end of research skills, AI does not signal the end of reading and writing, or education in general. [78] [79] \n",
            "Elementary teacher Shannon Morris explains that AI tools like “ChatGPT can help students by providing real-time answers to their questions, engaging them in personalized conversations, and providing customized content based on their interests. It can also offer personalized learning resources, videos, articles, and interactive activities. This resource can even provide personalized recommendations for studying, help with research, provide context-specific answers, and offer educational games.” She also notes that teachers’ more daunting tasks like grading and making vocabulary lists can be streamlined with AI tools. [79] \n",
            "For adults, AI can similarly make work easier and more efficient, rather than signaling the rise of the robot employee. Pesky, time-consuming tasks like scheduling and managing meetings, finding important emails amongst the spam, prioritizing tasks for the day, and creating and posting social media content can be delegated to AI, freeing up time for more important and rewarding work. The technology can also help with brainstorming, understanding difficult concepts, finding errors in code, and learning languages via conversation, making daunting tasks more manageable. [80] \n",
            "AI is a tool that, if used responsibly, can enhance both learning and work for everyone. Carri Spector of the Stanford Graduate School of Education says, “I think of AI literacy as being akin to driver’s ed: We’ve got a powerful tool that can be a great asset, but it can also be dangerous. We want students to learn how to use it responsibly.” [81] \n",

            "Artificial intelligence is commonly integrated into smartphones and other household devices. Virtual assistants, including Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, can perform innumerable tasks from making a phone call to navigating the internet. People who are deaf and hearing impaired can access transcripts of voicemails or other audio, for example. [20] \n",
            "Other virtual assistants can transcribe conversations as they happen, allowing for more comprehension and participation by those who are communicationally challenged. Using voice commands with virtual assistants can allow better use by people with dexterity disabilities who may have difficulty navigating small buttons or screens or turning on a lamp. [20] \n",
            "Apps enabled by AI on smartphones and other devices, including VoiceOver and TalkBack, can read messages, describe app icons or images, and give information such as battery levels for visually impaired people. Other apps, such as Voiceitt, can transcribe and standardize the voices of people with speech impediments. [20] \n",
            "Wheelmap provides users with information about wheelchair accessibility. And Evelity offers indoor navigation tools that are customized to the user’s needs, providing audio or text instructions and routes for wheelchair accessibility. [20] \n",
            "Other AI implementations such as smart thermostats, smart lighting, and smart plugs can be automated to work on a schedule to aid people with mobility or cognitive disabilities to lead more independent lives. [21] \n",
            "More advanced AI projects can combine with robotics to help physically disabled people. HOOBOX Robotics, for example, uses facial recognition software to allow a wheelchair user to move the wheelchair with facial expressions, making movement easier for seniors and those with ALS or quadriparesis.

            "AI doesn’t get stressed, tired, or sick, three major causes of human accidents in the workplace. AI robots can collaborate with or replace humans for especially dangerous tasks. For example, 50% of construction companies that used drones to inspect roofs and other risky tasks saw improvements in safety. [14] [15] \n",
            "Artificial intelligence can also help humans be safer. For instance, AI can ensure employees are up to date on training by tracking and automatically scheduling safety or other training. AI can also check and offer corrections for ergonomics to prevent repetitive stress injuries or worse. [16] \n",
            "An AI program called AI-SAFE (Automated Intelligent System for Assuring Safe Working Environments) aims to automate the workplace personal protective equipment (PPE) check, eliminating human errors that could cause accidents in the workplace. As more people wear PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses, this sort of AI could protect against large-scale outbreaks. [17] [18] [19] \n",
            "In India, AI was used in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic to reopen factories safely by providing camera, cell phone, and smart wearable device-based technology to ensure social distancing, take employee temperatures at regular intervals, and perform contact tracing if anyone tested positive for the virus. [18] [19] \n",

            "AI will harm the standard of living for many people by causing mass unemployment as robots replace people.\n",
            "AI robots and other software and hardware are becoming less expensive and need none of the benefits and services required by human workers, such as sick days, lunch hours, bathroom breaks, health insurance, pay raises, promotions, and performance reviews, which spells trouble for workers and society at large. [51] \n",
            "48% of experts believed AI will replace a large number of blue- and even white-collar jobs, creating greater income inequality, increased unemployment, and a breakdown of the social order. [35] \n",
            "The axiom “everything that can be automated, will be automated” is no longer science fiction. Self-checkout kiosks in stores like CVS, Target, and Walmart use AI-assisted video and scanners to prevent theft, alert staff to suspicious transactions, predict shopping trends, and mitigate sticking points at checkout. These AI-enabled machines have displaced human cashiers. About 11,000 retail jobs were lost in 2019, largely due to self-checkout and other technologies. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a self-checkout manufacturer shipped 25% more units globally, reflecting the more than 70% of American grocery shoppers who preferred self- or touchless checkouts.

            "An Oct. 2020 World Economic Forum report found 43% of businesses surveyed planned to reduce workforces in favor of automation. Many businesses, especially fast-food restaurants, retail shops, and hotels, automated jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. [35] \n",
            "Income inequality was exacerbated over the last four decades as 50-70% of changes in American paychecks were caused by wage decreases for workers whose industries experienced rapid automation, including AI technologies. [56] [57] \n",

            "The idea that the Internet is making us stupid is legitimate, and AI is like the Internet on steroids.\n",
            "With AI bots doing everything from research to writing papers, from basic math to logic problems, from generating hypotheses to performing science experiments, from editing photos to creating “original” art, students of all ages will be tempted (and many will succumb to the temptation) to use AI for their school work, undermining education goals. [82] [83] [84] [85] [86]\n",
            "“The academic struggle for students is what pushes them to become better writers, thinkers and doers. Like most positive outcomes in life, the important part is the journey. Soon, getting college degrees without AI assistance will be as foreign to the next generation as payphones and Blockbuster [are to the current generation], and they will suffer for it,” says Mark Massaro, professor of English at Florida SouthWestern State College. [83]\n",
            "A June 2023 study found increased use of AI correlates with increased student laziness due to a loss of human decision-making. Similarly, an Oct. 2023 study found increased laziness and carelessness as well as a decline in work quality when humans worked alongside AI robots. [87] [88] [89]\n",
            "The implications of allowing AI to complete tasks are enormous. We will see declines in work quality and human motivation as well as the rise of dangerous situations from deadly workplace accidents to George Orwell’s dreaded “groupthink.” And, when humans have become too lazy to program the technology, we’ll see lazy AI, too. [90]\n",
            "Google’s AI chatbot Gemini even generated politically motivated, historical inaccuracies by inserting people of color into historical events they never participated in, further damaging historical literacy. “An overreliance on technology will further sever the American public from determining truth from lies, information from propaganda, a critical skill that is slowly becoming a lost art, leaving the population willfully ignorant and intellectually lazy,” explains Massaro.

            "Facial recognition has been found to be racially biased, easily recognizing the faces of white men while wrongly identifying Black women 35% of the time. One study of Amazon’s Rekognition AI program falsely matched 28 members of the U.S. Congress with mugshots from a criminal database, with 40% of the errors being people of color. [22] [36] [43] [44] \n",
            "AI has also been disproportionately employed against black and brown communities, with more federal and local police surveillance cameras in neighborhoods of color, and more social media surveillance of Black Lives Matter and other Black activists. The same technologies are used for housing and employment decisions and TSA airport screenings. Some cities, including Boston and San Francisco, have banned police use of facial recognition for these reasons. [36] [43] \n",
            "One particular AI software tasked with predicting recidivism risk for U.S. courts–the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (Compas)–was found to falsely label Black defendants as high risk at twice the rate of white defenders, and to falsely label white defendants as low risk more often. AI is also incapable of distinguishing between when the N-word is being used as a slur and when it’s being used culturally by a Black person. [45] [46] \n",
            "In China, facial recognition AI has been used to track Uyghurs, a largely Muslim minority. The U.S. and other governments have accused the Chinese government of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang where a large population of Uyghurs live. AI algorithms have also been found to show a “persistent anti-Muslim bias,” by associating violence with the word “Muslim” at a higher rate than with words describing people of other religions including Christians, Jews, Sikhs, and Buddhists.

            "Facial recognition technology can be used for passive, warrantless surveillance without knowledge of the person being watched. In Russia, facial recognition was used to monitor and arrest protesters who supported jailed opposition politician Aleksey Navalny, who was found dead in prison in 2024. Russians fear a new facial recognition payment system for Moscow’s metro will increase these sorts of arrests. [36] [37] [38] \n",
            "Ring, the AI doorbell and camera company owned by Amazon, partnered with more than 400 police departments, allowing the police to request footage from users’ doorbell cameras. While users were allowed to deny access to any footage, privacy experts feared the close relationship between Ring and the police could override customer privacy, especially when the cameras frequently record others’ property. The policy ended in 2024, but experts say other companies allow similar invasions. [39] [91]\n",
            "AI also follows you on your weekly errands. Target used an algorithm to determine which shoppers were pregnant and sent them baby- and pregnancy-specific coupons in the mail, infringing on the medical privacy of those who may be pregnant, as well as those whose shopping patterns may just imitate pregnant people. [40] [41] \n",
            "Moreover, artificial intelligence can be a godsend to crooks. In 2020, a group of 17 criminals defrauded $35 million from a bank in the United Arab Emirates using AI “deep voice” technology to impersonate an employee authorized to make money transfers. In 2019, thieves attempted to steal $240,000 using the same AI technology to impersonate the CEO of an energy firm in the United Kingdom. [42] \n",

            "Key takeaways\n",
            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is hitting the mainstream, though the first form of AI was invented in England, way back in 1951.\n",
            "Nowadays AI is used in a wide range of applications, from our personal assistants like Alexa and Siri, to cars, factories and healthcare.\n",
            "AI has the power to make massive improvements to our quality of life, but it’s not perfect.\n",
            "Artificial intelligence, or AI, is everywhere right now. In truth, the fundamentals of AI and machine learning have been around for a long time. The first primitive form of AI was an automated checkers bot which was created by Cristopher Strachey from the University of Manchester, England, back in 1951.\n",
            "It’s come a long way since then, and we’re starting to see a large number of high profile use cases for the technology being thrust into the mainstream.\n",
            "Some of the hottest applications of AI include the development of autonomous vehicles, facial recognition software, virtual assistants like Amazon’s\n",
            "AMZN\n",
            " Alexa and Apple’s\n",

            " Siri and a huge array of industrial applications in all industries from farming to gaming to healthcare.\n",
            "And of course, there’s our AI-powered investing app, Q.ai.\n",
            "But with this massive increase in the use of AI in our everyday lives, and algorithms that are constantly improving, what are the pros and cons of this powerful technology? Is it a force for good, for evil or somewhere in between?\n",

            "The Pros of AI\n",
            "There’s no denying there are a lot of benefits to using AI. There’s a reason it’s becoming so popular, and that’s because the technology in many ways makes our lives better and/or easier.\n",
            "Fewer errors\n",
            "Humans are great. Really, we’re awesome. But we’re not perfect. After a few hours in front of a computer screen, we can get a little tired, a little sloppy. It’s nothing that some lunch, a coffee and a lap around the block won’t fix, but it happens.\n",
            "Even if we’re fresh at the start of the day, we might be a bit distracted by what’s going on at home. Maybe we’re going through a bad breakup, or our football team lost last night, or someone cut us off in traffic on the way into work.\n",
            "Whatever the reason, it’s common and normal for human attention to move in and out.\n",
            "These lapses of attention can lead to mistakes. Typing the wrong number in a mathematical equation, missing out a line of code or in the case of heavy duty workplaces like factories, bigger mistakes which can lead to injury, or even death.\n",
            "24/7 Uptime\n",
            "Speaking of tiredness, AI doesn’t suffer from sugar crashes or need a caffeine pick-me-up to get through the 3pm slump. As long as the power is turned on, algorithms can run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without needing a break.\n",
            "Not only can an AI program run constantly, but it also runs consistently. It will do the same tasks, to the same standard, forever.\n",
            "For repetitive tasks this makes them a far better employee than a human. It leads to fewer errors, less downtime and a higher level of safety. They’re all big pros in our book.\n",
            "Analyze large sets of data - fast\n",
            "This is a big one for us here at Q.ai. Humans simply can’t match AI when it comes to analyzing large datasets. For a human to go through 10,000 lines of data on a spreadsheet would take days, if not weeks.\n",
            "AI can do it in a matter of minutes.\n",
            "A properly trained machine learning algorithm can analyze massive amounts of data in a shockingly small amount of time. We use this capability extensively in our Investment Kits, with our AI looking at a wide range of historical stock and market performance and volatility data, and comparing this to other data such as interest rates, oil prices and more.\n",
            "AI can then pick up patterns in the data and offer predictions for what might happen in the future. It’s a powerful application that has huge real world implications. From an investment management standpoint, it’s a game-changer.\n",
            "The Cons of AI\n",
            "But it’s not all roses. Obviously there are certain downsides to using AI and machine learning to complete tasks. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t look to use AI, but it’s important that we understand its limitations so that we can implement it in the right way.\n",
            "Lacks creativity\n",
            "AI bases its decisions on what has happened in the past. By definition then, it's not well suited to coming up with new or innovative ways to look at problems or situations. Now in many ways, the past is a very good guide as to what might happen in the future, but it isn’t going to be perfect.\n",
            "There’s always the potential for a never-before-seen variable which sits outside the range of expected outcomes.\n",
            "Because of this, AI works very well for doing the ‘grunt work’ while keeping the overall strategy decisions and ideas to the human mind.\n",
            "From an investment perspective, the way we implement this is by having our financial analysts come up with an investment thesis and strategy, and then have our AI take care of the implementation of that strategy.\n",
            "We still need to tell our AI which datasets to look at in order to get the desired outcome for our clients. We can’t simply say “go generate returns.” We need to provide an investment universe for the AI to look at, and then give parameters on which data points make a ‘good’ investment within the given strategy.\n",
            "Reduces employment\n",
            "We’re on the fence about this one, but it’s probably fair to include it because it’s a common argument against the use of AI.\n",
            "Some uses of AI are unlikely to impact human jobs. For example, the image processing AI in new cars which allows for automatic braking in the event of a potential crash. That’s not replacing a job.\n",
            "An AI-powered robot assembling those cars in the factory, that probably is taking the place of a human.\n",
            "The important point to keep in mind is that AI in its current iteration is aiming to replace dangerous and repetitive work. That frees up human workers to do work which offers more ability for creative thinking, which is likely to be more fulfilling.\n",
            "AI technology is also going to allow for the invention and many aids which will help workers be more efficient in the work that they do. All in all, we believe that AI is a positive for the human workforce in the long run, but that’s not to say there won’t be some growing pains in between.\n",
            "Ethical dilemmas\n",
            "AI is purely logical. It makes decisions based on preset parameters that leave little room for nuance and emotion. In many cases this is a positive, as these fixed rules are part of what allows it to analyze and predict huge amounts of data.\n",
            "In turn though, it makes it very difficult to incorporate areas such as ethics and morality into the algorithm. The output of the algorithm is only as good as the parameters which its creators set, meaning there is room for potential bias within the AI itself.\n",
            "Imagine, for example, the case of an autonomous vehicle, which gets into a potential road traffic accident situation, where it must choose between driving off a cliff or hitting a pedestrian. As a human driver in that situation, our instincts will take over. Those instincts will be based on our own personal background and history, with no time for conscious thought on the best course of action.\n",
            "For AI, that decision will be a logical one based on what the algorithm has been programmed to do in an emergency situation. It’s easy to see how this can become a very challenging problem to address.\n",
            "How to use AI for your personal wealth creation\n",
            "We use AI in all of our Investment Kits, to analyze, predict and rebalance on a regular basis. A great example is our Global Trends Kit, which uses AI and machine learning to predict the risk-adjusted performance of a range of different asset classes over the coming week.\n",
            "These asset classes include stocks and bonds, emerging markets, forex, oil, gold and even the volatility index (VIX).\n",
            "Our algorithm makes the predictions each week and then automatically rebalances the portfolio on what it believes to be the best mix of risk and return based on a huge amount of historical data.\n",
            "Investors can take the AI a step further by implementing Portfolio Protection. This uses a different machine learning algorithm to analyze the sensitivity of the portfolio to various forms of risk, such as oil risk, interest rate risk and overall market risk. It then automatically implements sophisticated hedging strategies which aim to reduce the downside risk of the portfolio.\n",
